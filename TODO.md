## Bug

When adding new field in entity with nested fields, doesn't work first time but working other times.

See benji project offer

## Important

- system that don't run fixture every go run main.go

## Features

- Permit {current} to be use as struct reference like dog_{current}

- Add * to multiply base on multiple entities the entity (like getting all entities starting with dog*, create entities for each one)

## Later if necessary

- Add primary key

- Add more drivers (now only mysql)

- Tests ahah
