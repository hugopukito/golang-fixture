# TODO

## Features

- Add {random} for string, int, etc.
 -> loop on randomValues to check if each value is convertible to right type

- Implement nested structs
 -> give id (if not specified, than will be write in sql) for each struct than needs id before starting inserting entities
- Permit {current} to be use as struct reference like dog_{current}
- Add * to multiply base on multiple entities the entity (like getting all entities starting with dog*, create entities for each one)

## Later if necessary

- Add primary key
