## Bug

Problem, can't user Employer User but only User User works
User type and Employer name of field

When adding new field in entity with nested fields, doesn't work first time but working other times.
 -> Probably because was using CompanyId instead of Company
See benji project offer

## Important

- system that don't run fixture every go run main.go

## Features

- Permit {current} to be use as struct reference like dog_{current}

- Add * to multiply base on multiple entities the entity (like getting all entities starting with dog*, create entities for each one)

## Later if necessary

- Add primary key

- Add more drivers (now only mysql)

- Tests ahah
