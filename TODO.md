# TODO

## Features

- Implement nested structs
 -> give id (if not specified, than will be write in sql) for each struct than needs id before starting inserting entities

- Permit {current} to be use as struct reference like dog_{current}

- Add * to multiply base on multiple entities the entity (like getting all entities starting with dog*, create entities for each one)

## Later if necessary

- Do loading bar when lots of entities that take more that 1s to create

- Add primary key
